Spaced Repitition ReadMe

This program attempts to reproduce the real-life tool of flash cards. It accepts name-value pairs, stores them in a  data structure, and later retrieves them.

* input and store  name-value pair in datastructure and external file
** enter-data function
add key-value pairs to hash  
** populate function
   continue to add key-value pairs in *key-value-hash* until user enters "n"
** save-db/load-db function
   saves *key-value-hash* table to external file. load-db sets *key-value-hash* values from external files, overwriting any previous values.
* access name and value pairs
** In progress interval function
   calculates the repitition intervals
*** Important! add timestamp to each card for interval calculation
 - [ ] rewrite cards to use defstruct
 - [ ] add timestamp and interval parameters
interval algorithm follows two modes, pass or fail. pass increments interval by one, fail decreases interval by one
** In progress show-hash function
accesses and shows all key-value pairs starting first with the key, then showing both key and value.
* gui bindings
