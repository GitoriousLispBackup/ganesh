Spaced Repitition ReadMe

This program attempts to reproduce the real-life tool of flash cards. It accepts name-value pairs, stores them in a  data structure, and later retrieves them.

* input and store  name-value pair in datastructure and external file
** enter-data function
   add key-value pair, interval (default interval is 0), and date information. date format is seconds since the epoch.

** populate function
   add multiple key-value pairs in *main-list*.

** save-db/load-db function
   writes value of *main-list* to external file. load-db sets *main-list* values from external files, overwriting any previous values.

* access name and value pairs
** show-cards function
   accesses and shows today's due cards, then asks for a passing or failing mark. interval algorithm follows two modes, pass or fail. pass increments interval by one, fail decreases interval by one.
*** adjust-interval function
    adjusts card interval based on interval information and pass or fail mark
*** adjust-date function
    takes interval information and adjusts card's interval.
** date-compare function
   populates *today-list* with due cards from *main-list*
** which-db functon
   lists available databases and loads the selected one.
** card-invert fuction
   inverts keys and values for all cards.
* algorithm
** interval function
   calculates the repetition intervals. intervals are based on the formula
   $$ \textit{ where } I(1) = 1 $$ 
   $$ I(2) = 7 $$ 
   $$ I(3) = 16 $$ 
   $$ I(4) = 35 $$
   $$ \textit{for {i>4}}, I(i) = I({i-1})\times{2} $$

* custom REPL for user flow
** custom-read function
   adds parenthesis to commands to create valid s-expressions.
** custom-eval function
   evalulates the s-expression if it falls within allowed commands
** custom-loop function
   loop for custom-eval and custom-read
* gui bindings
