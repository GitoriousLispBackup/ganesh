Spaced Repitition ReadMe

This program attempts to reproduce the real-life tool of flash cards. It accepts name-value pairs, stores them in a  data structure, and later retrieves them.

* input and store  name-value pair in datastructure and external file
** enter-data function
add key-value pairs, plus interval and date information
*** Important! replace get-universal-time with day-since-the-epoch function

** populate function
   continue to add key-value pairs in *main-list* until user enters "n"

** save-db/load-db function
   saves *key-value-hash* table to external file. load-db sets *main-list* values from external files, overwriting any previous values.

* access name and value pairs
** interval function
   calculates the repitition intervals
*** Important! add timestamp to each card for interval calculation
 - [X] rewrite cards to use property lists
 - [-] add timestamp and interval parameters
interval algorithm follows two modes, pass or fail. pass increments interval by one, fail decreases interval by one

** In progress show-cards function
accesses and shows today's due cards, then asks for a passing or failing mark. intervals and dates are adjusted accordingly

** In progress sift function
filters today's cards from cards found in *main-list*

* gui bindings
