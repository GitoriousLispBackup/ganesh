Spaced Repitition ReadMe

This program attempts to reproduce the real-life tool of flash cards. It accepts name-value pairs, stores them in a  data structure, and later retrieves them.

* input and store  name-value pair in datastructure and external file
** enter-data function
add key-value pairs, plus interval and date information

** populate function
   continue to add key-value pairs in *main-list* until user enters "n"

** save-db/load-db function
   saves *key-value-hash* table to external file. load-db sets *main-list* values from external files, overwriting any previous values.

* access name and value pairs
** interval function
   calculates the repitition intervals

** show-cards function
   accesses and shows today's due cards, then asks for a passing or failing mark. interval algorithm follows two modes, pass or fail. pass increments interval by one, fail decreases interval by one.
*** adjust-date function
    takes interval information and adjusts card's interval.

** date-compare
   populates *today-list* with due cards from *main-list*

* custom REPL for user flow

* gui bindings
